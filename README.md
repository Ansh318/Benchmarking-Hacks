# Benchmarking-Hacks
In this project I designed a lockbox that operates like any other lock. It has a fixed correct password and I will try to open the lockbox using two different approaches. This will allow me to analyze the time complexity of both methods and determine which is the more efficient method or algorithm to unlock this lockbox
